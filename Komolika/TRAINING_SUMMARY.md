| Image File | Generated Caption |
|------------|------------------|
| `1000268201_693b08cb0e.jpg` | "man in red shirt is sitting on the steps" |
| `1001773457_577c3a7d70.jpg` | "dog jumps through the air" |
| `1002674143_1b742ab4b8.jpg` | "young boy in yellow shirt is running through the air" |
| `1003163366_44323f5815.jpg` | "two dogs are sitting on the area" |

## 🚀 How to Use the Trained Model

### 1. Quick Test
```bash
# Activate environment
source kenv/bin/activate

# Test with any image
python test_simple.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
```

### 2. Interactive Demo
```bash
# Run interactive demo
python demo_simple.py

# Or with command line argument
python demo_simple.py path/to/your/image.jpg
```

### 3. Python API
```python
from demo_simple import load_model_and_tokenizer, generate_caption_for_image

# Load model once
model, tokenizer, xception_model, max_length = load_model_and_tokenizer()

# Generate captions for multiple images
caption = generate_caption_for_image(
    "image.jpg", model, tokenizer, xception_model, max_length
)
print(f"Caption: {caption}")
```

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

### Encoder (Image Processing)
- **CNN**: Pre-trained Xception model
- **Input**: 299×299 RGB images
- **Output**: 2048-dimensional feature vectors

### Decoder (Caption Generation)
- **Embedding**: 256-dimensional word embeddings
- **LSTM**: 256 hidden units
- **Dense**: 256 → vocabulary_size
- **Activation**: Softmax for word prediction

### Training Process
1. **Feature Extraction**: Xception CNN extracts visual features
2. **Text Processing**: Tokenize and pad caption sequences
3. **Training**: LSTM learns to predict next word given image features + previous words
4. **Optimization**: Adam optimizer with categorical crossentropy loss

## 📈 Training Configuration

```python
# Dataset
train_images = 500          # Subset of Flickr8k
validation_split = 0.2      # 20% for validation

# Model Parameters
embedding_dim = 256         # Word embedding size
lstm_units = 256           # LSTM hidden units
dense_units = 256          # Dense layer size
vocab_size = 2272          # Unique words in vocabulary

# Training Parameters
epochs = 5                 # Training epochs
batch_size = 32           # Batch size
max_length = 35           # Maximum caption length
optimizer = 'adam'        # Adam optimizer
